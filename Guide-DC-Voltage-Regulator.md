# Adjustable DC voltage regulator

An adjustable voltage regulator produces a DC output voltage, which can be adjusted to any other value of certain voltage range. Hence, adjustable voltage regulator is also called as a variable voltage regulator. The DC output voltage value of an adjustable voltage regulator can be either positive or negative.
