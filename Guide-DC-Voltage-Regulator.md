# Adjustable DC voltage regulator

An adjustable voltage regulator produces a DC output voltage, which can be adjusted to any other value of certain voltage range. Hence, adjustable voltage regulator is also called as a variable voltage regulator. The DC output voltage value of an adjustable voltage regulator can be either positive or negative.

- Join the right terminal of the potentiometer to the left terminal of the LM317 
- Connect a negative input in the middle terminal of the potentiometer 
-  Connect a negative output to the middle terminal of the potentiometer. 
- Test the product
