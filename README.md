# OER for Reuse of Discarded Electronic Materials
**(DIY Power Bank, variable voltage regulator, Eco-friendly lamp, Led light)**

## Description
Reusing Electronics Materials is crutial in the context of a Refugee Settlement and helps understanding electronic components.
Reuse refers to the act of finding new uses for items or materials that would otherwise go to waste, various DIY projects can showcase the concept of reuse, encouraging learners to think creatively and resourcefully. Here are some Projects from E- waste: -



## Learning Objective 
### DIY power bank.
By repurposing old lamps  batteries or salvaging usable components from discarded electronics, learners can create a portable power source for charging their devices. This project not only reduces waste but also promotes self-sufficiency and innovation.

### Variable DC voltage regulator
Instead of purchasing expensive regulators, learners can repurpose components from old electrical devices to build one themselves. This not only saves money but also reduces the demand for new electronics, contributing to a more sustainable environment.

[**Instruction Guide for building the regulator**](DC-Voltage-Regulator.md)


### Eco-friendly lighting/Led light 
By repurposing glass bottles, jars, or other containers, learners can create unique and aesthetically pleasing lighting fixtures. Moreover, using energy-efficient LED bulbs can further enhance the sustainability aspect, reducing energy consumption and promoting eco-conscious habits.
