The most sustainable lamp materials are recycled and/or recyclableâ€”such as scrap cardboard, glass waste, plastic bottles, and salvaged wood. When new natural materials are used (such as bamboo, wood, and shells) they should be responsibly sourced ![Schematic for Bright light](/images/laamp.jpg)


# Steps in the making:
### Step 1: 
_Gather all the materials_ you will need for making the lamp, including batteries, a switch, a transparent container, cardboard for covering the container at the top, a battery case, wires, a bright LED, and a lamp holder.

### Step 2: 
_Start by preparing the transparent container_ You can use an old glass jar or a plastic container with a lid. Make sure it is clean and free from any debris.

### Step 3: 
_Punch a small hole in the container lid to accommodate the wires from the LED and the switch_ This hole should be big enough to pass the wires through without any difficulty.

### Step 4: 
_Take the LED and attach it to the wires_ Connect the positive side of the LED to the red wire and the negative side to the black wire. You can use electrical tape or soldering to secure the connections. Ensure proper insulation to avoid any short circuits.

### Step 5: 
_Connect the wires from the LED to the battery case_ The red wire should be connected to the positive terminal, and the black wire to the negative terminal. Again, make sure the connections are secure and properly insulated.

### Step 6: 
_Attach the switch to the wires_ Connect the red wire to one terminal of the switch, and the black wire to the other terminal. Secure the connections, ensuring they are properly insulated.

### Step 7: 
_Place the batteries in the battery case_ Make sure the positive and negative terminals of the batteries match the corresponding terminals in the case. Close the case tightly to secure the batteries.

### Step 8: 
_Insert the wire with the LED and switch through the hole in the container lid_ Ensure the LED is facing downwards and goes inside the transparent container.

### Step 9: 
_Attach the lamp holder on top of the container lid_ Ensure it fits securely and does not obstruct the LED.

### Step 10: 
_Cut a piece of cardboard to cover the top of the transparent container where the lamp holder is attached_ This will act as a diffuser for the LED light and provide a softer glow.

### Step 11: 
Place the cardboard cover on top of the container, making sure it fits snugly.
