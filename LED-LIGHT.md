 _**Steps in the making**_ 

 Step 1: _Preparing the LEDs_ Start by identifying the positive (anode) and negative (cathode) terminals of each LED. The longer leg of the LED is usually the positive terminal (anode), while the shorter leg is the negative terminal (cathode). Take note of this distinction for both the red and green LEDs.

Step 2: _Creating the LED circuit_ Cut two small lengths of wire from the USB cable, ensuring that each wire is long enough to connect the LEDs to the circuit. Strip a small portion of insulation from each end of the wires to expose the copper strands. Next, solder one wire to the positive terminal of the red LED and the other wire to the positive terminal of the green LED. Make sure the soldered connections are secure. Cover the exposed connections with electrical tape to insulate them.

Step 3: _Assembling the disco lights_ Take the plastic container and decide where you want to place the LEDs. You can drill or heat a hole using a hot nail on the container's surface, ensuring it's large enough to fit the LEDs snugly. Be careful not to damage the container while drilling or heating. Insert the red and green LEDs into the holes you created, with the positive terminals facing outwards. Secure them in place using a small amount of hot glue or adhesive if needed.

Strip a small portion of insulation from the cut ends of the wires. Connect the positive wire from the USB cable to the negative terminal (cathode) of the red LED using solder. Similarly, connect the negative wire from the USB cable to the negative terminal (cathode) of the green LED. Ensure the solder connections are secure and insulated with electrical tape.

Step 5: Powering the disco lights Connect the USB cable to a power source, such as a computer, laptop, or USB wall charger. The LEDs should light up, creating a colorful disco effect inside the plastic container.

> **Warning**: Be cautious when working with electronics and soldering irons. Ensure your workspace is well-ventilated and take proper safety precautions.
